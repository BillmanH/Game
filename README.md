# Game
I built a hub for the games that I have been making in d3

## Zombie Game: Using the LinkedIn API
I wanted to create a Zombie Game that leverages the LinkedIn API and D3.js library. The LinkedIn part is not here. It's on an EC2 instance that isn't online yet. I'm waiting until I have enough completed of the game to make it somewhat playable. 
###This game will feature:
	- live action decision making as objects's decisions are in a repeating-recursive loop and are always moving. 
	- LinkedIn data will be used to create a database of players who, upon death, will become zombies.
	- Players who still have living accounts will be introduced as NPCs in other people's games.

###Problems:
	- Zombie wander function isn't working. :(
	- function(repeat) seems to overload the browser, I wonder if there is a better way to do this. 
	
## Dungeon Craw: Turn based "Net - Hack" game
###This game will feature:
	- All single player 
	- users will be able to add monsters, treasure, stories.
